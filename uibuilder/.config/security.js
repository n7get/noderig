/**
 * Template security functions for uibuilder.
 * Only used if the node.useSecurity flag is set.
 * Please replace with your own code.
 * 
 * You MUST export the following functions:
 *   - userValidate - based on an id, lookup the user data to see if the user is valid.
 *                    MUST return a boolean or object of type userValidation.
 *                    Called from the server's logon process. (uiblib.js::logon)
 *      
 * 
 * Each function MUST at least return true/false. See each function for more details.
 *
 * NOTES & WARNINGS:
 *   1) IF there is an error in this JavaScript, it is very likely that Node-RED will terminate.
 *   2) You can use different security.js files for different instances of uibuilder.
 *      Simply, place a securiy.js file in the instances root folder (e.g ~/.node-red/uibuilder/<url>/security.js)
 *      Note, however, that this means that the security.js file can be edited using the admin Editor.
 *      You have to restart Node-RED to pick up the new file.
