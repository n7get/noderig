Ham Radio ('rig') automation program.

### About

From the 'CAT Operation Reference Manual':

The CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) System in the FT-991A transceiver provides control of frequency, VFO, memory, and other settings such as dual- channel memories and diversity reception using an external personal computer. This allows **multiple control operations to be fully automated** with single mouse clicks, or keystroke operations on the computer keyboard.

That in a nutshell is the purpose of this software.  It's not a remote control application, there are already high quality applications such as HRD, flrig, Win4Yaesu, et al.  This software for the operator who is working to provide emergency communications (Emcomm).  The purpose o this software is to automate the radio to aid the operator in getting the messages to where they are going.
